	Once upon a time there was a dragon named {name1}. Their parents told them that they should kidnap a {profession}, so that they would be respected in the dragon community. Or at the very least they should try to expand their collection of {object}s. But Waffles respected {profession}s to much to capture one. So they struck a deal with a {profession} named {name2}. They would "kidnap" her in order to prevent her from {verb_ending_with_-ing} her betrothed, Prince {name3}. In return she would give them enough {object}s to have a modest hoard. So they followed the plan. But Prince {name3} would not accept this defeat. He came to {name1}'s lair demanding them to let him see his beloved. {name1} was about to burn him to a crisp when {name2} burst out of concealment. She realized that rather than running away from her problems she should go out and {verb} them. It was the support that she got from {name1} that gave her the strength to tell {name3} that she didn't love him. Although Prince {name3} was disappointed that {name2} did not love him he understood, as he did not want to make her {emotion}.  
The End.
